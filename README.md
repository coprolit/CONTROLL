CONTROLL
========

Gamepad adapter app for Sphero robotic ball.

The application let's you control your Sphero with a physical gamepad. Connect and pair the Sphero to your computer via bluetooth, plug in a gamepad, and drive your robotic ball using a classic RC control scheme.

The application is wrapped as a Chrome app for access to Chrome.Bluetooth API:

(In the near future we will have access to the 'Web Bluetooth API' that enable the browser to connect to a Bluetooth device - then we don't need the Chrome app wrapper anymore.
